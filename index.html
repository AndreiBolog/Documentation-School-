                <h3>Description of the Test</h3>
                <hr style="background-color: black;height: 1px;">
                <p>In the process of restructuring the content of our website Huset-KBH, we have conducted a card sorting test on a few fellow students. Through this test we are looking to find out if the content is intuitive enough, easy to use and understand, and also for us to find out what works find and what changes we should bring. As we said, the test was conducted on students currently studying design and with awareness of basic website content structure. The website and structure was at their first glance. When introducing them to the test we gave them a short description to what the website is about and instructions for completing the test. </p>

                <h3>Results And Conclusion</h3>
                <hr style="background-color: black;height: 1px;">
                <p>Above this text you can find the results of each individual test we obtained. Each of our subjects found a general structure for the content with the Events section being of high importance, and all of them placed a high importance on About section and Events structuring the subsections almost in the same way. Making a comparison of the original menu and the results obtained through the test we can see that there are no major differences between the two and that we should come up with only some subtle changes. </p>

                <hr style="background-color: black;height: 1px;">
                <p>Finding out that the original structure of the menu is somewhat close to what people expect to see, we have decided in the first place to change the name of the FAQ section with General Info which is more appropriate to the content and information found in the section. We also created a new main section named as Opportunities which will contain as subsections the Lease, Volunteering and Job and Internship sections. After these changes we believe that the first time users that find and explore the website, they will find a improved structure and I will be very intuitive to find and access the content that they are interested in. </p>
